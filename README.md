# Set Solver
A program which analyzes a picture to find a solution for a game of [Set] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(game))

Currently under active development, the road map is to get it solving set games
based on images, and then to get it on android (where it should solve games
using the camera directly)
